# Proto
Proto is basically a interpreter for the kind of made up assembly-like language used in Computer Architecture texts. This particular one is inspired by Computer System Architecture by M. Mano.
Proto supports common register, stack based and accumulator based organizations, as well as allows registering and referencing variables (but only zero, one and two addressing modes). It is still a work-in-progress. Use at your own discretion
